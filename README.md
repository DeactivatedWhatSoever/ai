# Artificial Intelligence
This is where I put my artificial intelligence study outputs.
They're going to be Jupyter notebooks, have mathematical stuff.
The reason I'm not putting maths and code is, because they're direct application examples of AI.
Pure mathematics will be in the `mathematics` repository, and pure code will be in the `code` repository.

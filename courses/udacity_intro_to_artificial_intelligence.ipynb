    "# Welcome to AI\n",
    "It's too hard to put in all the sections over here, so let's just go with it with headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to AI Class!\n",
    "Just an introduction, put damn this course was made in 2011. I've been chickening out on AI for 8 years. Better get started fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Overview\n",
    "Okay, we get to learn the basics of AI, and get excited lol. The structure of the course is going to be, videos -> quizes -> answers -> assignments. So we get quick feedback on what we learned. We have to pause and think about what we learned. That's the important part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intelligent Agents\n",
    "We call AI programs, intelligent agents. And they sort of have a cycle called perception action cycle. Agent -> sensors -> environment -> actuators -> agent. So the agent has sensors, and the sensors sense stuff from the environment. Because of that sense of environment, the actuators start to act on what the environment is reflecting, and the we give the results back to the agent. So it's a cycle, a loop that runs forever. It's like a server, but just taking input from the environment that it's learning, is what I think. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of AI\n",
    "The applications of AI in every field in the present time. And I can't believe it was already being applied roughly 10 years ago. It's about the intelligent agents. The field of application will be the agent's domain. If it's a finance agent, then it'll sense information from the financial markets, bonds, or any financial related market, you'll process the sensed data into trades and other verbs that you can execute in the financial industry. I know this is just one, but there were other examples like games, robotics, medicine, web(just web crawling), and etc. So it's important to get the concept of agent, sensor, environment, and actuators and apply them to specific domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "We have a lot of things to take in over here. But I need to get better on just one.\n",
    "* Fully vs Partially Observable\n",
    "    * Whether sensing the environment is full or partial.\n",
    "    * If it's full, you can get every information about the environment.\n",
    "    * If it's partial, you get partial information about the environment.\n",
    "* Deterministive vs Stochastic\n",
    "    * Whether the sensed environment commands occur 100% or under 100%.\n",
    "    * If it's deterministic, commands occur 100%.\n",
    "    * If it's stochastic, commands occur in a certain probability.\n",
    "* Continuous vs Discrete\n",
    "    * Whether the sensed environment is restricted or infinite.\n",
    "    * If it's continuous, the environment is infinute to sense.\n",
    "    * If it's discrete, the environment is restricted to sense.\n",
    "* Adverserial vs Benign\n",
    "    * Whether the sensed environment has objectives or no objectives.\n",
    "    * If it's adversrial, the environment gives sensable objectives.\n",
    "    * If it's benign, the environment doesn't give sensable objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poker Question\n",
    "* Partially Observable\n",
    "* Stochastic\n",
    "* Continous\n",
    "* Adveerserial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Robot Car Question\n",
    "* Fully Observable -> Partially Observable: You don't know what cars are going anywhere. Or any other object.\n",
    "* Deterministic -> Stochastic: Okay, everything doesn't do that 100% like physics.\n",
    "* Continuous: Infinute map!\n",
    "* Benign: Everything ain't sensable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI and Uncertainty\n",
    "So AI is used to manage uncertainty. Yes. We can't really generalize everything. But that's what we want. But the reason we're making generalizations is because we want a 'certain' output from a 'certain' input. It's just like pure functions in functional programming. Everyone wants the same output from the same input. If we put in some input and some other kind of output comes out, that's when we started to get screwed, and hard to rely on. We need things that are reliable. \n",
    " AI makes this reliability. It manages the uncertainty that we can't determine all the time. We get uncertainty from sensor limits, laziness(when we just ignore stuff), ignorance, stochastic environments, adverserials.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Machine Translation\n",
    "This was about translating languages. We had to find the correspondents of each word, phrase, and make a probability table of whether it'll actually mean such thing for each word and phrase, or even sentences! We first make a model, and apply that model with input data. And we keep on building out the model until the translation gets more accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chinese Translation 1, 2, 3\n",
    "It was just an example, and all I did was pick what Chinese character has a correspondant of an Enlgish word or phrase. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Okay, I learned about:\n",
    "1. Intelligent agents\n",
    "2. The 4 attributes of intelligent agents\n",
    "3. Some applications of the agents and a translation example\n"
